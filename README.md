# React Date Picker App

This is my submission for CSE186 Summer 2024 Assignment 3. In this project, I implemented a simple React web app using JSX components to create a date picker with a focus on automated testing and accessibility. This assignment helped me strengthen my skills in React, JSX, and test-driven development.

## Project Overview
The project implements a date picker component using React and JSX. I recreated the functionality of a vanilla JavaScript date picker (from a previous assignment) using React components. I also implemented various tests to confirm the date picker works as expected. I followed the provided guidelines closely and ensured accessibility by using `aria-labels` instead of `IDs` for visual elements.
